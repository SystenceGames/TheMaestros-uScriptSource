# TheMaestros-uScriptSource
The primary package of unrealScript source code from RTS/MOBA game The Maestros

Note that this is a single code package, and while it contains core functionality like fog of war, ability systems, unit spawning, etc., it cannot be started and run on it's own.  We will soon release a more complete version of the game's code with instructions on how to run it
